            <strong>Eventray</strong> was a startup I helped co-found to provide an integrated suite of tools for professional conference organizers. Think Microsoft Office or Google Docs, but specialized for organizations that produce conferences like TED or SXSW. We used <strong>Python</strong>'s Pyramid framework, new features of <strong>HTML5</strong> with polyfills, <strong>d3.js</strong> for reports and <strong>Backbone.js</strong> with <strong>Marionette.js</strong> to keep our front-end code well-organized.

          <p>
            At <strong>Constant Contact</strong> I was part of a sort of front-end skonkworks team working on their next generation document editor. I frequently finished assignments ahead of schedule and took it upon myself to improve processes and technology where I could. I championed Test Driven Development with <strong>Jasmine.js</strong>, introduced <strong>Backbone.js</strong> and participated in discussions on improving inter-team communication. The color-picker interface pictured to the right I coded using <strong>Raphael.js</strong> and trigonometry.

            I was contracted by a startup to create their user interface. I really wish I could show you the live demo as I'm quite happy with how it looks (and they are too) but they requested that I keep it secret since the product is still under development. I used <strong>Backbone.js</strong> and lots of fancy <strong>CSS3</strong>.

          At <strong>Synack</strong> I was mainly a font-end developer, but I also wrote some <strong>Ruby</strong> on <strong>Rails</strong>. I was their go-to expert on JavaScript best practices. The assignment I'm most proud of is the ID verification step in their on-boarding process, which was highly dynamic and involved using the camera via <strong>HTML5</strong> and integrating with <strong>Jumio</strong> on the back-end.

            This is my just-for-fun Web port of the word game included in BSD Unix, which is itself based on the tabletop game by Hasbro. I used <strong>Backbone.js</strong>. Click <a href="http://patrickcan.neocities.org/boggle.html" target="_blank">here</a> to play.

             Another personal project. I hacked this together as an implementation of a solution I gave to an interview question. It uses <strong>Meteor</strong> for a snappy, real-time experience. The landing page also has a link to an old portfolio site of mine. Click <a href="http://divvy.meteor.com" target="_blank">here</a> to try it.

          <p>I was contracted remotely to help develop a mobile app called <strong>FitRx</strong>, which is a social network for people trying to stick to a exercise regimen. We used <strong>Cordova</strong> so we could have one codebase and target all major platforms and we used the <strong>Ionic</strong> framework for a native look and feel, which meant we also used <strong>Angular.js</strong>.
        </div>
        <div class="VerticalSection u-clearfix">
          <strong>Venturescope</strong> is my latest personal project. It will be a mobile app inspired by my world travels in 2015 built using <strong>Go</strong> and <strong>Ionic</strong> framework and <strong>Backbone.js</strong>.

        <div class="VerticalSection u-clearfix">
          I built my travel blog <a href="http://onup.me" target="_blank">onup.me</a> using <strong>Python</strong> with the <strong>Flask</strong> framework fronted by <strong>Nginx</strong> for fast static assets and with formatting help from <strong>Markdown</strong>.

          And then there's this website you're looking at right now, which was build using <strong>Go</strong>.
